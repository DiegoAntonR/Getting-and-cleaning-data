#Introduction 
The script run_analysis.R perform 5 steps.
First, all the similar data is merged using the rbind() function.
By similar, we address those files having the same number of columns and referring to the same entities.
Then, only those columns with the mean and standard deviation measures are taken from the whole dataset. 
On the whole dataset, those columns with vague column names are corrected.
Finally, we generate a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject 
and activity type (30 subjects * 6 activities = 180 rows).
The output file is called tidydataset.txt, and uploaded to this repository.

#Variables
The files that have been used to load data are listed as follows:
·test/subject
·test/X_test.txt
·test/y_test.txt
·train/subject_train.txt
·train/X_train.txt
·train/y_train.txt


Values of Varible Activity consist of data from “Y_train.txt” and “Y_test.txt”
values of Varible Subject consist of data from “subject_train.txt” and subject_test.txt"
Values of Varibles Features consist of data from “X_train.txt” and “X_test.txt”
Names of Varibles Features come from “features.txt”
levels of Varible Activity come from “activity_labels.txt”
So we will use Activity, Subject and Features as part of descriptive variable names for data in data frame.

Finally, tidydataset contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a .txt file. ddply() from the plyr package 
is used to apply colMeans() and ease the development.
